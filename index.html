    <h1 id="introduction">A. Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I am currently working in a DevOps/DevSecOps/Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) role at [Company Name]. I have extensive experience in automating infrastructure provisioning, managing CI/CD pipelines, working with Kubernetes, and ensuring high availability of cloud-based systems.</p>

    <h1 id="core-responsibilities">1. Core Responsibilities</h1>
    <h2>Infrastructure Automation:</h2>
    <p>I specialize in automating infrastructure provisioning on AWS using Terraform. I also use Ansible for configuration management and application deployment to Kubernetes clusters.</p>
    <h2>CI/CD Pipelines:</h2>
    <p>I have hands-on experience with Jenkins for end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I write Jenkins pipelines as code for microservices deployed to OpenShift and Kubernetes. I have built CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, GitLab, Bamboo, and Spinnaker, particularly for Node.js, Angular, and Java applications.</p>

    <h1 id="kubernetes">2. Kubernetes</h1>
    <p>I have worked with on-premises Kubernetes clusters using tools like Rancher, Kubeadm, and Kubespray. Additionally, I have experience with cloud-managed Kubernetes solutions, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) on GCP.</li>
        <li>AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) on Azure.</li>
        <li>EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) on AWS.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’ve also created Helm charts for deploying microservices on Kubernetes.</p>

    <h1 id="cloud-experience">3. Cloud Experience</h1>
    <p>On AWS, I have worked extensively with the following services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Compute and Networking:</strong> EC2, VPC, Route 53, Elastic Load Balancers.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage and Databases:</strong> S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Elasticache (Redis).</li>
        <li><strong>Container Services:</strong> EKS, ECR, and Lambda for serverless functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> IAM roles and policy management, security groups, and routing configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>DevOps Services:</strong> CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’ve also configured DMS (Database Migration Service) for database backups, migrations, and active replication from PCF to AWS EKS.</p>

    <h1 id="monitoring-logging">4. Monitoring and Logging</h1>
    <h2>Monitoring Tools:</h2>
    <p>I have experience setting up Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for pod-level monitoring. I’ve used Alertmanager for sending alerts from Kubernetes clusters.</p>
    <h2>Logging Solutions:</h2>
    <p>I’ve worked on setting up the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) inside Kubernetes clusters. I’ve configured Filebeat as a Kubernetes DaemonSet for log shipping. I’ve also set up Splunk Connect for Kubernetes and configured Fluent Bit for logging solutions on AKS.</p>

    <h1 id="conclusion">5. Conclusion</h1>
    <p>To summarize, I have a strong background in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes management, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring tools, and log management. I’m passionate about optimizing infrastructure, enhancing application deployments, and solving challenges in the cloud-native ecosystem.</p>
